Whenever we make a request to a specified Company Name through Python, it returns a response object. Now, this response object would be used to access certain features such as content, headers, etc. This article revolves around how to check the response.json() out of a response object. It is one of the most used methods in requests module.

Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Thanks for checking it out.

All documentation is in the "docs" directory and online at https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/. If you're just getting started, here's how we recommend you read the docs:

First, read docs/intro/install.txt for instructions on installing Django.
Next, work through the tutorials in order (docs/intro/tutorial01.txt, docs/intro/tutorial02.txt, etc.).
If you want to set up an actual deployment server, read docs/howto/deployment/index.txt for instructions.
You'll probably want to read through the topical guides (in docs/topics) next; from there you can jump to the HOWTOs (in docs/howto) for specific problems, and check out the reference (docs/ref) for gory details.
See docs/README for instructions on building an HTML version of the docs.
